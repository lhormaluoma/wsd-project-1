# Project 1: Shared shopping list

This project produces and deploys a web app: shopping list

It's built with JavaScript, a PostgreSQL database and ETA templates

The main page shows statistics of all shopping lists and items, the lists page allows you to create new lists and following links to the created lists, you can add items to the lists and mark them collected.

It uses the nostalgic Windows 7 inspired framework for visuals

It's hosted through render, on https://wsd-project-i-wops.onrender.com
